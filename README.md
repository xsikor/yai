## What is Yai ?

`Yai` (your AI) is an assistant for your terminal, using [OpenAI ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) or [Anthropic Claude](https://claude.ai/) to build and run commands for you. You just need to describe them in your everyday language, it will take care or the rest. 

You have any questions on random topics in mind? You can also ask `Yai`, and get the power of AI without leaving `/home`.

It is already aware of your:
- operating system & distribution
- username, shell & home directory
- preferred editor

And you can also give any supplementary preferences to fine tune your experience.

## Documentation

A complete documentation is available at [https://ekkinox.github.io/yai/](https://ekkinox.github.io/yai/).

## Quick start

To install `Yai`, simply run:

```shell
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekkinox/yai/main/install.sh | bash
```

You can also choose your AI provider on the command line:

```shell
# Use OpenAI (default)
yai -p openai "list all docker containers"

# Use Google Gemini
yai -p gemini "show me all running processes"

# Use Anthropic Claude
yai -p claude "generate a random password"

# Use a specific model
yai -p gemini -model gemini-2.0-flash "explain kubernetes"
yai -p openai -model gpt-4 "optimize this algorithm"
```

At first run, it will ask you for an API key for your chosen provider, and use it to create the configuration file in `~/.config/yai.json`:
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) (default)
- [Google Gemini API key](https://ai.google.dev/)
- [Anthropic Claude API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

See [documentation](https://ekkinox.github.io/yai/getting-started/#configuration) for more information.
